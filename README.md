parallel_histogram
==================

Various approaches to parallel (threaded) histogram generation based on the ideas in http://www.futurechips.org/tips-for-power-coders/writing-optimizing-parallel-programs-complete.html

My plan was to start by doing this in straight Java with threads, and then switch over to some other 
languages like Clojure. To date, all that's ever happened is the Java bit, but other people are welcome to
share other implementations. We'd probably need to re-arrange the directory structures if we do that, but that's
not a big deal.
